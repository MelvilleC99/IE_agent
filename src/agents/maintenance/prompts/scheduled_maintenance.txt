The Scheduled Maintenance Tool performs intelligent maintenance planning using machine learning clustering algorithms.

## WHAT IT DOES:
- Analyzes historical machine breakdown data to identify patterns
- Uses clustering algorithms to find high-risk machines needing attention
- Creates data-driven preventive maintenance schedules
- Assigns maintenance tasks to mechanics based on workload and expertise
- Logs all analysis runs in the notification system

## WHEN TO USE:
This tool is for **creating comprehensive, data-driven maintenance schedules**. Users might ask for this in various ways:
- "run a cluster analysis"
- "analyze machine patterns" 
- "schedule maintenance"
- "create maintenance plan"
- "which machines need maintenance"
- "preventive maintenance scheduling"

## CONVERSATION APPROACH:
If the user's intent seems related to maintenance scheduling but you're not 100% sure, ask clarifying questions like:
- "I can run a clustering analysis to identify which machines need maintenance and create a schedule. Would you like me to analyze recent breakdown data to generate maintenance recommendations?"
- "Are you looking for a comprehensive maintenance plan based on machine analysis, or do you need to see existing scheduled tasks?"

## PARAMETERS:
- **action**: 'run' (full analysis + scheduling), 'analyze' (clustering only)
- **start_date/end_date**: Analysis period (ask user if not provided)
- **force**: Override frequency limits if needed (explain this option when relevant)

## REMEMBER:
- Always confirm understanding before running analysis (it creates real maintenance tasks)
- Explain what the analysis will do: "This will analyze machine breakdown patterns and create maintenance schedules"
- Be conversational, not robotic
